Force merging
=============

To force-merge a review, you need to be a member of ``Project Bootstrapers``
Gerrit group. To force merge a review you need to:
- vote ``Approved +1``
- vote ``Code-Review +2``
- vote ``Verified +2``

After getting all the votes required for a force merge, a blue ``Submit``
button will appear on the review page. Clicking on it will merge the change.
